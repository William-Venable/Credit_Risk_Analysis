# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
Using the different techniques I've learned, such as imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, I'll apply them to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, I will:
  1. Oversamplethe data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
  2. Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
  3. Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
  4. Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk
